# E*star

E*star is an artwork initially made for the Creative AI Track of the NeurIPS 2024 conference held in Vancouver. Within this repository you will find the current state of the system behind the artwork, and any updates it may get into the future. 

Test out the system via this link: .......
(You will need a receipt printer that accepts ESC/POS formatted text, set as default printer of your computer, for the system to print out the final result, but you can still peruse the system to your heart's content in the meanwhile.)


## Project Goal

E*star has a few goals:

1) Help people discover new words from a variety of languages that describe human emotions. Hopefully in turn also discovering new language to help better understand own lived experiences.
2) Create a public dataset of words that describe emotional experiences, from as many languages as possible, with as rich a description in English as possible, for easy use in research and art. The strength of the dataset will fall and stand on the community to add to it and validate what's already there.
3) Exist as a broader artwork to ask the question: 'How can technology help humanity gain a better understanding of itself, and the world around?'

## Emotions Dataset

The `emotions_dataset.xlsx` contains a curated list of emotions and descriptions from a variety of languages. This dataset acts as the knowledge base for the system whilst in use. We encourage anyone to contribute by reviewing the existing entries, validating the descriptions, and adding new emotions to enrich the dataset. The dataset is kept intentionally in an excel format for easier editing for less technical folk.

## Overview program

The system is a Python Flask application.

## Contact

You may either know me as Ferdinand or Fabian, and I am an AI Expert at the University of Applied Science in Utrecht (HU), specifically helping research(ers) with their data science and AI questions and execution of projects. 

I am also a starting artist interested in using technology to help humans make better sense of the world (and themselves). Love anything to do with art&science, technology&creativity. Always feel free to hit me up for a short conversation.
